# agentic_chunking

With reference from [langchain tutorial on agentic chunking](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/rag/langgraph_agentic_rag/#graph)

Take note that Azure was used and the ipynb in the tutorial is converted into a singular python script. I was unable to connect to langchain to pull prompt template so I manually created a file called [prompt_template](prompt_template.py) to insert the prompt template.
